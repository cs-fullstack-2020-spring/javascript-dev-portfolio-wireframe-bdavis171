# Dev Portfolio Wireframes

## Wireframes
Create the initial wireframes for your developer portfolio that support the following sections:

- About Me (Tell your story)
  - Tell the world about you and why you are a good fullstack developer.

- Skills
  - What languages and frameworks do you know. A lot of portfolios show this as a picture or animated graphic.

- Show off projects
  - Send them to a working link to your project, a github repository, or a video of you walking them through your project.

- Education
  - Do you have a degree, certifications, or currently attending CodeCrew's Code School?

- Resume
  - Include an HTML resume or PDF. Make sure they can download your resume as well.

- Contact
  - How can someone get in contact with you? Leave a way for people to sign up to receive updates. 

- Weekly Reflections (if applicable)
  - Show your weekly reflections of the class using video, audio, or text.

You may use paper and/or wireframing software to create your wireframes however you *must attach* a vewable versions of your wireframes and push to this project.
